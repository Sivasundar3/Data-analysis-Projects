### Create a Gross Sales Report for Monthly Product Transactions

-- 1. Perform joins to pull product information

	SELECT s.date, s.product_code, p.product, p.variant, s.sold_quantity 
	FROM fact_sales_monthly s
	JOIN dim_product p
        ON s.product_code=p.product_code

    	    get_fiscal_year(date)=2021     
	LIMIT 1000000;

-- 2. Performing join with 'fact_gross_price' table with the query(1) and generating required fields

	SELECT 
    	    s.date, 
            s.product_code, 
            p.product,
